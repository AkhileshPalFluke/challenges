# Omise Code Challenges

This repository houses Omise's interviewing code challenges. These are small hands-on
projects that are very relevant to the tasks you will be working on at Omise.

### Ground Rules

* We prefer well-thought-out solutions over the quick-and-dirty kind. So take your time,
  if you need it. A rushed job is usually matched by a swift rejection.
* Average completion time so far has been around one to two weeks.
* Submission is done via a [git format-patch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch). Attach
  your patches in an e-mail and send it to [jobs@omise.co](mailto:jobs@omise.co).

### Challenges
